#Note
The original dataset downloaded from Kaggle are not completely right. The file named "WorldCupMatches.csv" has repeated data in Year 2014 data. I have changed it to the correct one, which is in this folder

#Explanation for event abbreviation:
G = Goal Y = Yellow card RSY = Red card by second yellow card R = Red card O = Substitution out I = Substitution in OH = Substitution out in the half-time IH = Substitution in in the half-time W = Own goal P = Penalty scored MP = Missed Penalty U = Unknow event
99′ = Minute in which the event occurred
The events I - O and IH - OH are complementary. When a player leaves another player enters in the same minute of the match.
